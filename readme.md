# Bar@173

## Project requirements:

- Easily be able to add new users.
- Each user have their own profile picture, which we can easily add and change and will display on the leaderboard scoreboard
- Multiple drinking sessions and history tracking for each user for different days we use the drinking app. Each drinking session starting with which drinks are on tap/available today?
- Drinks, different drinks available to add with different prices.
- One tablet optimised endpoint/url screen, which is designed to be easy to use for people to quickly add their drink when they go to the bar, click on the tablet and say what drink they had.
- A different tv optimised leaderboard, called the 'scoreboard' with all of the people on that particular drinking session that day, with bars to show who has had the most drinks, and what drinks, maybe a multi coloured bar, chaging colour depending on what drink they have had.

Bonus Features

The top drinker of the day was j
- Spin the wheel for some outcome
